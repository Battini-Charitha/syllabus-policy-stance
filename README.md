# Syllabus Policy Stance Analysis

This project studies how higher-education institutions articulate policies
around external knowledge and technology (e.g., Wikipedia, generative AI)
through course syllabi.

## Research Questions
- How do institutions govern the use of external knowledge tools?
- How do these stances vary across departments, institutions, and time?
- Can historical governance of Wikipedia inform future AI policy adoption?

## Project Structure
- src/extraction/        Sentence segmentation
- src/filtering/         Entity-aware filtering (Wikipedia, AI tools)
- src/stance/            Rule-based and model-assisted stance classification
- annotation/            Annotation guidelines and labeled data
- notebooks/             Exploratory analysis
- analysis/              Aggregate results and figures

## Status
- Repository initialized
- Data ingestion and stance taxonomy design in progress
